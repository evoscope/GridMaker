The script takes the image and turns it into sqares that are filled with letters based on the abundancy of letters in the german language. This script only creates the form, to create an actual word puzzle, the words still have to be put in by hand.

Fonts, square size and abundancy of letters can be adjusted.

The script works best using purely black and white images and clear forms.
